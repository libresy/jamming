Feature Request: Pressing Enter Triggers a Search

May 20, 2018

OBJECTIVE 
Give users the ability to search by pressing enter on their keyboard.

BACKGROUND
Jamming currently only supports searching after typing an artist, song or album 
and pressing the "search" button below the input field. The user has to click out 
of the search box and then click the button, it feels tedious to use the mouse.
This feature will allow the user to click "enter," following their typed query
This is expected user behavior and is available on most sites (see Google).
Users expect this functionality.

TECHNICAL DESIGN
To implement this feature we will add new  Javascript method, onKeyDown to the SearchBar 
component. onKeyDown will take one parameter, an event. The event's key value will be 
the "enter" key. The .render() method of SearchBar will call the new method.


CAVEATS
If the "enter" key is pressed for a long enough time, it may start to repeat and the 
keydown will repeatedly trigger. We can later address this concern by adding timestamps
and calculating the difference between them before triggering the event.
